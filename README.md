## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive report on the benefits and process of migrating FishTank LTD to the AWS cloud. The report is divided into two main sections:
1. FishTank LTD Migration Proposal
2. FishTank LTD Cloud Migration

## FishTank LTD Migration Proposal
This section outlines the short, medium, and long-term benefits of cloud migration, addressing potential objections and cultural challenges. It provides FishTank LTD with a clear understanding of the value and strategic advantages of moving to the AWS cloud.
 
## FishTank LTD Cloud Migration
This section details the migration process, including an AWS architecture diagram and a comprehensive pricing breakdown. It serves as a practical guide for FishTank LTD to understand the steps involved and the financial implications of moving to the cloud.

Key Components:

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I have gained a deep understanding of AWS cloud services and how to apply this knowledge in a consultancy-style report. This experience has equipped me with the skills to effectively communicate the benefits of cloud migration and provide detailed, actionable plans for businesses considering this transition.
